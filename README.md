# Envbar

Envbar is a simple package that will add a colored bar to the top of your pages to indicate the current environment and
the current branch or release.

## Installation

To install this package is very simple, you just need to install it with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require --dev larakitdev/envbar
```

After installing, you need to publish the assets and the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="LaraKit\EnvBar\EnvBarServiceProvider" --tag="assets"
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="LaraKit\EnvBar\EnvBarServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

To keep the assets up-to-date and avoid issues in future updates, you may add the `envbar:publish` command to the
`post-update-cmd` scripts in your application's `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "@php artisan envbar:publish --ansi"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is located in `config/envbar.php`. All the necessary instructions are in the file.
